🌌 64-Bit Solar System & The Y2K38 Crisis
A Photorealistic Orbital Simulation & Logic Lab
This project is a high-fidelity web simulation of our Solar System, designed to demonstrate the critical difference between 32-bit and 64-bit computational logic.
While the planets orbit following Newtonian physics, the underlying clock tracks the "Unix Epoch." This allows users to witness the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Problem in real-time.
🛠️ Educational Core Concepts
1. The Solar System Model
Scale & Motion: Each planet (Mercury through Neptune) is programmed with relative orbital speeds. Mercury zips around the Sun, while the outer gas giants move with massive, slow momentum.
Visual Physics: The Sun acts as the primary light source. Using CSS box-shadow: inset, each planet features a "Dark Side" that always faces away from the Sun, simulating natural day/night cycles.
Atmospheric Glow: Earth and the Sun utilize layered gradients to simulate Rayleigh scattering (the blue glow of an atmosphere) and solar corona discharge.
2. The Y2K38 Problem (The "Epochal" Bug)
The most important part of this lab is the Time Logic:
32-bit Signed Integers: Many older systems (and our "Glitch Mode") store time as a 32-bit number. The maximum value is 
.
The Overflow: On January 19, 2038, at 03:14:07 UTC, this number hits its limit. Adding just one more second causes an Integer Overflow, flipping the bit to negative.
The Result: The system "wraps around" to December 13, 1901. In our simulation, this causes the orbital math to fail, the universe to freeze, and the UI to crash—simulating what would happen to a 32-bit satellite or bank server.
🚀 How to Use the Lab
Observe the 64-Bit Stability: By default, the system uses modern 64-bit JavaScript floats. Click "Jump to 2038" and watch the clock pass the deadline smoothly. This represents how NASA, CNSA, and modern web servers stay safe.
Trigger the Crash: Click "Force 32-bit Crash". The code will now use a math formula to simulate 32-bit restrictions.
The Result: Once the clock hits the limit, the date will jump back 136 years, and the CSS animations will pause, showing a "System Failure."
💻 Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure for the cosmic viewport.
CSS3: Uses GPU-accelerated animations (transform: rotate) and 3D Perspective for a realistic telescope view.
JavaScript: Handles the temporal logic and simulates the binary overflow math.
📖 Glossary for Students
Epoch: The starting point of time for a computer (January 1, 1970).
Integer Overflow: When a number is too big for its "container," causing it to reset or become negative.
64-Bit: The modern standard for computing, capable of tracking time for trillions of years.
Parallax: The effect where background stars move slower than foreground planets, creating 3D depth.
📡 Project Mission
"To understand the heavens, we must first master the mathematics of the machines we use to view them."
